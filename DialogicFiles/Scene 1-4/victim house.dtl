Narrator: On the way to the victim’s house, the group walks down a quiet street. The atmosphere is heavy, and there’s an underlying sense of suspicion building, especially with the Friendly Girl acting a bit too eager to help.
- Option 1
	Player: You know, I’ve been thinking... How did you know where [the victim] lives? I mean, we’ve never really heard you talk about hanging out much, but now you're here, like, leading the way.
- Option 2
	Player: Wait, wait, hold up how do you know where [the victim] lives? I thought you two weren’t exactly besties before. Did you google it, or is there something I don’t know?
"Friendly Girl": Oh, um... well, it’s not a big deal. We, uh, we used to be neighbors when we were younger. Like, really young. Our families were pretty close back then.
"Friend 1": Wait, what? You and [the victim] were neighbors? I never knew that.
"Friendly Girl": Yeah! It’s a while ago, but we were friends when we were kids. Our families... you know, spent a lot of time together. But after a while, we kind of grew apart.
Player: That’s... strange. I had no idea. So, you haven’t really kept in touch?
"Friendly Girl": Uh, not as much lately. But we still talk sometimes. I just felt like I should help, you know? After everything that happened.
"Friend 2": Hmm. That’s kind of weird. You’re sure it’s not about something else?
"Friendly Girl": Of course! I’m just concerned. I mean, we were close when we were kids, and it’s awful what happened. I just want to make sure [the victim] is okay.
Player: I don’t know... something about this whole situation doesn’t add up. But maybe I’m overthinking it.
"Friendly Girl": Don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine. We just need to be there for [the victim]. That’s what matters.
Narrator: The group falls silent for a moment, each of them feeling the weight of the situation. As they round the corner, the victim’s house comes into view.
Player: Something doesn’t feel right... but I guess we’ll find out soon enough.
"Friendly Girl": Here we are. Let’s make sure [the victim] knows we’re here to help.
Narrator: They reach the door, and the tension lingers in the air as they prepare to knock.
"Friend 3": What are we waiting for let's knock and see how the[victim] is doing.
