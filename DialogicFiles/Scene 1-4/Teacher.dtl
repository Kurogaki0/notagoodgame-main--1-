Teacher: The classroom falls silent as the teacher walks in. The students slowly take their seats, some are whispering, others glancing at the empty desk of the (victim).
\-[CUT SCENE plays]-
Teacher: Class you probably already know why one of your classmates is absent.
Teacher: There was a post shared on the school page. A post that targeted (victim).
Teacher: Alright, everyone, let’s hold off on the usual lesson for a moment. We need to talk about something important.
Teacher: I know most of you have seen or heard about the hurtful messages that were shared recently. Look, I’ll be honest this isn’t easy to talk about. But we have to. What happened wasn’t just mean it was flat-out wrong.
Teacher: Here’s the thing bullying whether it’s online or face-to-face hurts. A lot. And right now, someone in this school is dealing with that pain because of what was said. I want you all to think about that for a second. Imagine how you’d feel if it was you.
Teacher: This isn’t about pointing fingers or singling anyone out. It’s about making sure this doesn’t happen again. Bullying isn’t just against the rules it’s against everything we should stand for as classmates, as friends, as human beings. And let me make one thing very clear the person behind this will not go unpunished. Actions have consequences, and whoever is responsible will be held accountable.
Teacher: But this isn’t just about punishment. It’s about learning. You guys have a chance to be better to step up, to speak out when you see something wrong, and to choose kindness. If you see someone struggling, help them out. If you’re feeling targeted or know someone who is, come talk to me. No judgment, no lectures. Just help.
\-They let out a small sigh, standing up again-
Teacher: You’re better than this. I know you are. Let’s make this a class where everyone feels safe not just in this room, but everywhere. Deal?
Teacher: Alright, now let’s get back to the lesson but keep this in mind, okay? It’s important.
